## ‚ùì Questions Addressed

### 1. Who are Walmart‚Äôs highest-value customers‚Äîand where are they located?
We defined a **value score** to identify customers who not only spend more but also rate their experience highly. Demographic and behavioral breakdowns (gender, age, payment method, discount use, and repeat status) were analyzed.

Geographically, we used a choropleth map to highlight where high-value customers are located, identifying **California** and **Texas** as the most valuable states.

### 2. When do Walmart customers spend the most?
Using weekly and hourly time features, we plotted a **line chart** showing repeat vs. new customer spend trends, and a **heatmap** showing average spend by hour of day and day of week.

The findings revealed that **weekends**, especially between **10 AM and 3 PM**, were peak periods for purchases.
